Lim-Plugin-Orr - OpenDNSSEC Redundancy Robot

ABOUT

Orr can be configured to manage DNS, OpenDNSSEC and SoftHSM plugins in various
ways to create a redundant DNSSEC system. For example you can configure Orr to
setup a backup/failover system or make a signing cluster that will load balance
the work.

ARCHITECTURE

These are the components within Orr and a description on what they do.

  Lim::Plugin::Orr::Server
    The main RPC component, it starts a NodeWatcher and manage the
    database containing all configurations.

  Lim::Plugin::Orr::Server::DB
    The main database layer, it handles the database connection, creation
    and upgrade.

  Lim::Plugin::Orr::Server::NodeWatcher
    The main node logic component, it starts a watchers to manage the nodes and
    synchronize data between them.

  Lim::Plugin::Orr::Server::Node
    A node communication component, it simplifies communication with all
    the different plugins on the nodes. Used mainly by the NodeWatcher.

  Lim::Plugin::Orr::Server::ClusterManager
    The main cluster logic component, it will feed the NodeWatcher what it
    needs to do with the nodes.

  Lim::Plugin::Orr::Server::ZoneInput
    Component to gather the zone data/content from other external sources.

CLUSTER MODES

  BACKUP
    A multi-node setup where the information is backed up onto SECONDARY nodes
    and a manual switch is needed if the PRIMARY node fails.
    All nodes in both modes are active, running and processing zones.

  FAILOVER
    A multi-node setup where the information is backed up onto SECONDARY nodes
    and an automatic switch is performed if the PRIMARY node fails, upgrading
    a SECONDARY node to PRIMARY and downgrading the PRIMARY to SECONDARY.
    All nodes in both modes are active, running and processing zones.

  BALANCE
    A multi-node setup where the information is balanced over the nodes and is
    backed up across additional nodes by a given ratio. The nodes mode has no
    significance in this mode.
    Nodes with backed up information are not actively processing the backed up
    zone information.
    Upon a node failure, the active zones on that node will become active on
    one of the backed up nodes and then balanced out again to the configured
    ratio.

NODE MODES

  PRIMARY
    The primary node, considered as master. There SHOULD only be one.

  SECONDARY
    The secondary node, considered as slave/backup. There SHOULD at least be
    one.
